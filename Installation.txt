4. resolve the project by match all the libraries jar file from StationeryPro/dist/lib
5. Run The Project

*Note : You can run this project without download the database because i've 
stored the database in cloud and connected it with this project, but maybe 
in future the database will be removed from cloud, so you have to use your own server such as PHPMyAdmin.
to store the database in your local PHPMyAdmin, you have to do these things :
1. Make sure you have XAMPP and run the apache and mysql server
2. Go to localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser
3. create a new database and name it as stationerypro and import the database.sql into the database that you just created.
4. configure the database configuration in file named StationeryPro.java inside the project by following these steps :
		1. change the String url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stationerypro" or try it without port (without :3306)
		2. change the String user="root"
		3. change the String pass=""
save it and then run the project.

if you just want to view this app. you can run the executable jar file with the name StationeryPro.jar or just open the screenshots.
